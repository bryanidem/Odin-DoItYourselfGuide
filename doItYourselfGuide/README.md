# Do-It-Yourself Guide

Our application will be made of two components, `App` and `Overview`. Your application should render an input field and a submit button. With the submit button, you can add the content from your input to a “tasks array” that is managed in state. (We will use class components for this example because we haven’t introduced hooks in this section yet). Finally, for each task in the tasks array, an HTML list element should be rendered.
